* AmiraMesh 3D ASCII 2.0 parser

This repository has code and test files for AmiraMesh 3D ASCII 2.0
format for passing on branching and thickness information from
reconstructed biological cells.

* Code structure

  A 3D *skeleton* structure in *amiramesh* consists of *nodes* in a graph
  and *segments* that join them. *Points* along the segments are given to
  show the path of the segment. Each point also knows about
  approximate diameter or two at the position.

* Testing


   The code has been tested in Python 2.7.6.

   =bin/read_ameramesh.py -v= on sample datafiles should print out
   the same numbers that are given in the datafile header.

  Testing was done with ~nose~ and ~coverage~ to 100% coverage:

  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
    nosetests --with-coverage --cover-package amiramesh
  #+END_SRC
